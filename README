Wrap NCEP BUFRLIB using F2PY to use in python


Developed with Intel Fortran 12.1.5.  Compatibility with other compilers not guaranteed

Updated to work with gfortran!!!

compile scripts now work on OSX 10.8

Requires:
 + F2PY <http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/>
 + wget

Quick start:
 + go to install/
 + run compile.sh
 + return to ./
 + copy test_scripts/testbuild.py to ./
   - Or just make sure that py_bufrlib.so and testbuild.py are in same directory
 + run ./testbuild.py -h

Other Goodies
 + run testtab.py to get a dict of Table A mnemonics as a hierarcical function of Table D & Table B mnemonics.
 
 Eg.
 
 TableA:
    TableD: [TableB, tableB,,,,]
